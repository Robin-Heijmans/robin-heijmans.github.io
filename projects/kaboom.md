This project took 8 weeks, in which I worked in a team together with 11 other games students. The team consisted of 3 designers, 5 artists and 4 programmers, all from Breda University of Applied Sciences. The focus of the project was on teamwork and collaboration.

The game was made using Unreal Engine and we used the agile scrum method to manage the project. You can check out our itch.io page and download/play the game using the following link: <a href="https://buas.itch.io/team-ginger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaboom: Return of Kaboom</a>.

# My work
My main focus this project as a programmer was helping the team to create the game. Making gameplay related features according to the vision of the designers. Some of the things I did were:
- Talking with designers;
- Understanding their visions;
- Implementing these visions into the gameplay features;
- Iterating on the features I created, to improve the gameplay experience.

This project sparked my interest in collaborating with designers and creating a satisfying gameplay experience. Being able to implement the designer's vision into the behaviour of NPCs was incredibly enjoyable.

Below are some of the features I worked on:
- Neural network (NN) trained for pathfinding of enemy NPC airplanes and bombers;
- Interactions between the player and enemy NPC airplanes and bombers;
- Patrol behaviour for enemy NPC airplanes and bombers.
