I am a second-year Programming student at Breda University of Applied Sciences (BUas) with a degree in Applied Mathematics. I have loved mathematics since high school, it just made sense to me in a way that other subjects didn’t. I enjoyed solving exercises and applying the rules we learned in class. So, after high school I chose to pursue a degree in mathematics, which led me to the <a href="https://www.fontys.nl/Studeren/Opleidingen/Toegepaste-Wiskunde-voltijd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Mathematics</a> study at Fontys. During my studies, I not only deepened my understanding of mathematics but also learned programming through Python and MATLAB. I quickly realized that I loved coding just as much as math—it felt like a perfect fit. During my graduation internship I realized I wanted programming to play a bigger role in my career, particularly in the gaming industry, which has always been a passion of mine. As a Games Programmer, I get to combine the best of both worlds: programming and mathematics. This realization led me to BUas, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Games Programming and enjoying myself to the fullest.
