I am a second-year Programming student at Breda University of Applied Sciences with a background in
Applied Mathematics. After earning my degree, I realized I wanted programming to play a bigger role in my
careerâ€”especially in the gaming industry, which has always been a passion of mine. This led me to pursue a
degree in Games Programming at BUas, where I am currently enjoying myself to the fullest.
